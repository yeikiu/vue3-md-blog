This is me, writing this very line right now

There is a few interesting things to notice in the image, take a second look. Basically every time you want to create a new post
you will need to create a `new-post-file.md` file following a few simple rules:

- File must be located under `public/blog_store/posts/<category-name>/` folder

- You can create new folders in order to create new categories

- The heading of your file must match the following pattern, note the date format `<full_month_name month_day, full_year>`

# New awesome blog post title

Beginning of your new awesome blog post...

Once your post is ready to be seen by the ðŸŒŽ, simply push your changes to your repo and let `GitHub Actions` do its thing.

_Note:_ It might take a while for the changes to propagate through GitHub and your browserÂ´s cache, use incognito for a fresh check.
