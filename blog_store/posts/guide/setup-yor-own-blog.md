#### February 11, 2020


> This tutorial assumes you have the following installed on your system:
>
> - An active [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
> - [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
> - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)


## 1.- Get your own repo

Login into your GitHub account and start a new repo.

- Use `vue3-md-blog` [as a template](https://github.com/yeikiu/vue3-md-blog/generate)

## 2.- Configure your `src/blog_config.ts` file, i.e:

    VUE_APP_POSTS_PER_PAGE: 5,
    VUE_APP_MAIN_BG_CSS_COLOR: 'white',
    VUE_APP_MAIN_TEXT_CSS_COLOR: 'black',


## 3.- Test locally

Make sure your terminal is within your repos root folder and run `npm i`.

Then do `npm run dev` and you should be able to access the site under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## 4.- Deploy with GitHub Actions

### Configure repo to serve GitHub pages

- Activate GitHub pages option under your repo's settings menu. Make sure to choose `gh-pages` branch.

### Deploy full Site to gh-pages branch

> Runs any time you generate a new release on GitHub's repo

```
    name: deploy_to_gh_pages
    on:
      release:
        types: [ created ]
```

### Deploy only updated posts folder

> Check the `.github\workflows`files to understand how the site gets deployed automagically with GitHub Actions

- Verify branch `gh-pages` is updated with new data after you push some changes and workflows run.
