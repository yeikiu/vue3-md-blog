## Some aditional information

The last major electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event occurred in the 19th century and was caused by a solar storm known as the Carrington Event. At that time, electronic devices did not exist, so the impact of the EMP was limited to telegraph systems.

However, it is still possible for a solar storm or other event to cause an EMP that could damage or destroy electronic devices. This is because an EMP can induce high levels of voltage and current in electrical systems, which can overload and damage electronic components.

In addition, there is also the possibility of an EMP being caused by a high-altitude nuclear detonation, which could have a devastating impact on modern electronic devices.
Therefore, while the last major EMP event did occur in the 19th century, it is still important to consider the potential impact of an EMP on modern electronic devices and to take steps to prepare for such an event.
